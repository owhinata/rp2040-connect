# NuttX port

English | [日本語](README_ja.md)

This directory holds the port of the IMU measurement firmware in `zephyr/app/usb-console` to
NuttX 13.1.0. The port is in progress; only the setup is available so far.

## Setup

Everything is prepared under `nuttx/` without sudo. The host needs these tools:

- `git`, `curl` or `wget`, `tar`, `xz`, `sha256sum`
- `python3` with the `venv` module (`python3-venv` on Ubuntu)
- `make` and `gcc` (NuttX builds its host tools)

Source the setup script from the repository root.

```bash
source nuttx/script/setup.sh
```

The script fetches only what is missing and leaves what already exists alone, so it can be
sourced any number of times. Source it again in every new terminal. It fetches the following;
the versions are pinned at the top of the script.

| Location | Contents | Version |
|---|---|---|
| `nuttx/nuttx` | NuttX | tag `nuttx-13.1.0` (shallow clone) |
| `nuttx/nuttx-apps` | NuttX applications | tag `nuttx-13.1.0` (shallow clone) |
| `nuttx/pico-sdk` | Raspberry Pi Pico SDK, used only to build boot2 (the flash second stage) | tag `2.2.0` (shallow clone, no submodules) |
| `nuttx/toolchain/` | Arm GNU Toolchain (arm-none-eabi, for x86_64 Linux) | 13.2.Rel1 (SHA-256 checked) |
| `nuttx/.venv` | Python venv with kconfiglib, used by NuttX's `make menuconfig` and `olddefconfig` | kconfiglib 14.1.0 |
| `nuttx/stmemsc/` | ST's LSM6DSO register driver (`lsm6dso_reg.c`, `lsm6dso_reg.h`) | lsm6dso-pid v3.2.2 (the same content as Zephyr's hal_st; SHA-256 checked) |

It also does the following:

- Creates the symlinks `nuttx/nuttx/external` → `nuttx/drivers` and `nuttx/nuttx-apps/external` →
  `nuttx/apps`. NuttX builds this repository's drivers and applications through them.
- Applies `nuttx/patches/nuttx/*.patch` and `nuttx/patches/apps/*.patch`, if any, to `nuttx/nuttx`
  and `nuttx/nuttx-apps`. Patches already applied are not applied again.
- Sets `PICO_SDK_PATH` in the current shell and adds the toolchain's `bin`, `nuttx/.venv/bin` and
  `nuttx/script` to `PATH`.

`nuttx/script/kconfig-tweak` stands in for the `kconfig-tweak` that NuttX's `tools/configure.sh`
(through `tools/sethost.sh`) uses to edit `.config`. kconfiglib does not include it, so only the
features NuttX uses are implemented.

The fetched files are not tracked by Git. To change a version, edit the value at the top of the
script, delete the corresponding directory and source the script again.
